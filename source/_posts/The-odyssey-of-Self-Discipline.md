## Why I am so hard to stay disciplined?

I'd known I am one of the ADHDer(not so heavy, but just always losing my focus). The worst side of the influence is not the symptom (never ever) but the untangible mind which unconciously affect my behavior. I learned a word -- preconception and suddenly be enlightened.

I should be more self discipline and be more confident about my mind. 

But why it is still so hard to stay disciplined?

> Because we allow our mind to interface the path of discipline. Why do we fail to get in the early morning? Because the mind says, "You are so tired and sleep deprived. Just sleep for 5 minute more and it will be fine". Then % becomes 10, and it is all the way downhill after that.

We allow the fallacy that we will get up early or eat healthy or study well or do the right thing when we **get used to it and it becomes a little easier**. 

But it will NEVER get easier. It will never be easy to get up at 5 am, every single day of the year. Not now, not after 10 years. 

## What should I do?
The answer maybe trivially simple, but also very hard. I must stop listening to my mind. Just stop. No concession to what my mind says.

When I have to do something hard, I have to become a robot. It does not matter how I feel. Who cares? It does not matter how this thing will get well. Becuase it is a training, not just a task. I must get used to it and improve the way I used for handling stuff. At first, I just execute like the plan like a machine. 

Then I decide to go for a run, get up and run. I feel groggy and my legs hurt. The pain I feel is exactly the pain everybody else feels. The pain of discipline is the price of happiness. 


### People who win are those who keep going, regardless of how much it hurts.
